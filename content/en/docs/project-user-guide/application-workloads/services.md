## What is the Service

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

## Service Type

- **VirtualIP**：It is based on the unique IP generated by the cluster. The service inside the cluster can be accessed through this IP, and the service outside the cluster can be accessed through NodePort and LoadBalancer. This type is suitable for most services.
- **Headless**：The cluster does not generate an IP for the service, and the service is directly accessed through the back-end Pod IP of the service within the cluster. This type is suitable for back-end heterogeneous services, such as services that need to distinguish between master and slave.

{{< notice tip>}}

In Kubesphere, the **Virtual IP** is a default type of a service that is created by **stateless** or **stateful**.<br />

If you want to create a Headless service, you should use the mode of **YAML**.

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a workspace, project and `project-regular` account. Please refer to the [Getting Started with Multi-tenant Management](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project) if not yet.
- You need to sign in with `project-admin` account and invite `project-regular` to enter the corresponding project if not yet. Please refer to [Invite Member](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project#task-3-create-a-project).

## How to create a Service

![create_service_type](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/create_service_type.png)

Create a service that has these methods in the Kubesphere: **Stateless Service**, **Stateful Service**, and **External Service**. what's more, you can custom creation through **Specify Workloads** and **Edit by YAML**.

There are some ways to create a service

- **Stateless Service**

  Create a Stateless Service also create a **Deployment** workload.

  For more information **Stateless**, please visit [Deployment](../../application-workloads/deployments)

- **Stateful Service**

  Create a Stateless Service also create a **Statefulset** workload.

  For more information **Statefulset**, please visit [Statefulset](../../application-workloads/statefulsets)

- **External Service**

  The service created by External Service is a service internet access method. It is different from Stateless and stateful.

- **Specify Workloads**

  Create a service with existing Pods.

- **Edit by YAML**

  Create directly with Yaml, you can upload and download Yaml configuration files

{{< notice tip>}}

  The value of `annotations:kubesphere.io/serviceType` keywords is one of them **statelessservice** , **statefulservice** , **externalservice** and **None**.

## Create a **Stateless Service**

Into **Application Workload**, click **Services**

### Step 1: click the **Create**, choose **Stateless Service**

![services_lists](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_lists.png)

![stateless_form](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form.png)

### Step 2: Input Base data

![stateless_form_1](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_1.png)

- **Name**: The name of the Service and Deployment, which is also the unique identifier.
- **Alias**: The alias name of the service, making resources easier to identify.
- **Version**: It can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. The maximum length of characters is set to 16.

{{< notice tip >}}

**Name** have named two configs, `Deployment` and `Service`.

{{</ notice>}}

``` yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    version: v1
    app: xxx
  name: xxx-v1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      version: v1
      app: xxx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        version: v1
        app: xxx
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    version: v1
    app: xxx
  name: xxx
spec:
    metadata:
      labels:
        version: v1
        app: xxx
```

### Step 3: Input Container Image

![stateless_form_2.png](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_2.png)

To add a container for the service, please refer to [Pod Containers](../deployments) for details.

### Step 4: Input Volume

![stateless_form_3](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_3.png)

Refer to [Pod Volumes](../deployments) for details.

### Step 5: input Advanced Settings

![stateless_form_4](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_4.png)

Refer to [Deployment Advanced Settings](../deployments) for details.

## Check Service Detail

### Service Operations

![stateless_finish](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_lists_finish.png)

Now the Stateless Service has created, you can click it to view more information about it.also you can click **More** to operate this service item include edit config and delete.

- **Edit**: Edit the base data.
- **Edit YAML**: Edit the YAML config.
- **Edit Service**: Edit the service config.
- **Edit Internet Access**: Edit the service internet access.
- **Delete**: When deleting a service, the associated resources will be displayed. If you check them, they will be deleted together with the service

### Service Detail

![stateless_finish](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_detail.png)

- The **More** Operations is the same which in the services list.
- The pod list provides the pod's detail information(conditions, phase, node, pod ip, monitoring).
- You can view the container info by click the pod item.
- Click the container log icon to view the output logs of the container.
- You can view the pod detail page by click the pod name.
