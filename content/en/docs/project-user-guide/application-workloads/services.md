## What is the Service

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

## Service Type

- **VirtualIP**：It is based on the unique IP generated by the cluster. The service inside the cluster can be accessed through this IP, and the service outside the cluster can be accessed through NodePort and LoadBalancer. This type is suitable for most services.
- **Headless**：The cluster does not generate an IP for the service, and the service is directly accessed through the back-end Pod IP of the service within the cluster. This type is suitable for back-end heterogeneous services, such as services that need to distinguish between master and slave.

{{< notice tip>}}

In KubeSphere, stateful and stateless services are created with a virtual IP by default. If you want to create a Headless service, use **YAML** to configure it directly.

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a workspace, project and `project-regular` account. Please refer to the [Getting Started with Multi-tenant Management](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project) if not yet.
- You need to sign in with `project-admin` account and invite `project-regular` to enter the corresponding project if not yet. Please refer to [Invite Member](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project#task-3-create-a-project).

## How to create a Service

![create_service_type](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/create_service_type.png)

As shown in the image, KubeSphere provides three basic methods to create a service: **Stateless Service**, **Stateful Service**, and **External Service**. Besides, you can also customize a service through **Specify Workloads** and **Edit by YAML** under **Custom Creation**.

There are some ways to create a service

- **Stateless Service**

  A **Deployment** workload is also created when you create a stateless service. For more information about stateless services, see [Deployment](../../application-workloads/deployments)

- **Stateful Service**

  A **StatefulSet** workload is also created when you create a stateful service. For more information about stateful services, see [Statefulset](../../application-workloads/statefulsets)

- **External Service**

  Different from stateless and stateful services, an ExternalName service maps a service to a DNS name instead of a selector. You need to specify these services in the `externalName` field.

- **Specify Workloads**

  Create a service with existing Pods.

- **Edit by YAML**

  Create a service directly with YAML. You can upload and download YAML configuration files to and from the console.

  The value of `annotations:kubesphere.io/serviceType` keywords is one of them **statelessservice** , **statefulservice** , **externalservice** and **None**.

## Create a **Stateless Service**

Into **Application Workload**, click **Services**

### Step 1: click **Create**, and choose **Stateless Service**

![services_lists](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_lists.png)

![stateless_form](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form.png)

### Step 2: Input Base data

![stateless_form_1](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_1.png)

- **Name**: The name of the Service and Deployment, which is also the unique identifier.
- **Alias**: The alias name of the service, making resources easier to identify.
- **Version**: It can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. The maximum length of characters is set to 16.

{{< notice tip >}}

The value of **Name** is used in both configurations, one for `Deployment` and the other for `Service`.

``` yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    version: v1
    app: xxx
  name: xxx-v1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      version: v1
      app: xxx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        version: v1
        app: xxx
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    version: v1
    app: xxx
  name: xxx
spec:
    metadata:
      labels:
        version: v1
        app: xxx
```

### Step 3: Input Container Image

![stateless_form_2.png](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_2.png)

To add a container for the service, please refer to [Pod Containers](../deployments) for details.

### Step 4: Input Volume

![stateless_form_3](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_3.png)

Refer to [Pod Volumes](../deployments) for details.

### Step 5: input Advanced Settings

![stateless_form_4](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/stateless_form_4.png)

Refer to [Deployment Advanced Settings](../deployments) for details.

## Check Service Detail

### Service Operations

![stateless_finish](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_lists_finish.png)

After the stateless service is created, you can click the three dots on the right to further edit it, such as its metadata (excluding **Name**), YAML, port, and Internet access.

- **Edit**: Edit the base data.
- **Edit YAML**: Edit the YAML config.
- **Edit Service**: Edit the service config.
- **Edit Internet Access**: Edit the service internet access.
- **Delete**: When deleting a service, the associated resources will be displayed. If you check them, they will be deleted together with the service

### Service Detail

![stateless_finish](/images/docs/project-user-guide/workloads/services_detail.png)

- Click **More** to expand the drop-down menu which is the same as the one in the service list.
- The pod list provides the pod's detail information(conditions, phase, node, pod ip, monitoring).
- You can view the container info by clicking the pod item.
- Click the container log icon to view the output logs of the container.
- You can view the pod detail page by clicking the pod name.
