## What is Deployment

A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a workspace, project and `project-regular` account. Please refer to the [Getting Started with Multi-tenant Management](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project) if not yet.
- You need to sign in with `project-admin` account and invite `project-regular` to enter the corresponding project if not yet. Please refer to [Invite Member](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project#task-3-create-a-project).
