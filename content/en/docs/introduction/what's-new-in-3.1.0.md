On April 29, 2021, the KubeSphere community announced the general availability of KubeSphere 3.1.0. KubeSphere 3.1.0 provides an enabling environment for users as they deploy production workloads not just across clouds but also at the edge. Besides, the new Metering and Billing function helps you better understand the infrastructure operating costs. Existing features of multi-cluster management, multi-tenant management, observability, DevOps, application lifecycle management, and microservices governance have also been enhanced as we work to ensure better user experiences across clusters and clouds.

In addition to the above highlights, KubeSphere 3.1.0 also features other functionality upgrades and fixed the known bugs. There were some deprecated or removed features in 3.1.0. For more and detailed information, see [Release Notes for 3.1.0](../../release/release-v310/).
