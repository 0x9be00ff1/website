## Installing KubeSphere and Kubernetes on Linux

In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use KubeKey to provision a new Kubernetes and KubeSphere cluster based on different infrastructures. Kubekey can help you to quickly build a production-ready cluster architecture on a set of machines from zero to one. It also helps you to easily scale the cluster and install pluggable components on existing architecture.
